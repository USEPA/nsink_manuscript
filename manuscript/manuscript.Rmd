Introduction
============

Intro goes here and citations look like [@vitousek1997human; @finlay2013human; @filippelli2008global].

Methods
=======

Methods are what belong here and an inline fig citation looks like (`r fig_num("ww_map", display = "cite", caption = "Map of URI Watershed Watch lake and reservoir sampling sites")`) and to reference that fig, assuming it is an image file inside the ../figures folder would look this way [@bivand2014maptools].

![Figure 1: Map of URI Watershed Watch lake and reservoir sampling sites](media/image1.jpg){width="5.7in" height="7.45in"}

`r fig_num("ww_map", caption = "Map of URI Watershed Watch lake and reservoir sampling sites")`

If you want some inline R code, do this `r nrow(iris)`.

Results
=======

Results go here and if you want a table caption, do this (`r tab_num("ww_params", display = "cite", caption = "Summary statistics for URI Watershed Watch data from 1993 to 2016.")`). And then this in an example code chunk kicing out a pander table.

```{r ww_params, echo=FALSE, results="asis"}
pander::pander(head(iris), style = "rmarkdown")
```

`r tab_num("ww_params")`

Discussion and conclusions
==========================

Really great conclusions and discussion thereof goes here!
